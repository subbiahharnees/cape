It is an important catalyst for the operation of innovative ecosystems in developed countries in the US&nbsp;andEurope. It promotes the rapid development of high-tech industries represented by information&nbsp;and&nbsp;biotechnology,&nbsp;and&nbsp;cultivates apples. Many famous high-tech companies such as Google&nbsp;and&nbsp;Intel.&nbsp;Since 2015, Safran,&nbsp;Airbus, Loma,&nbsp;Boeing&nbsp;and&nbsp;other international&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturing giants have set up venture capital departments, investing in small start-ups engaged in cutting-edge technology development to capture&nbsp;innovation&nbsp;opportunities from outside the industry.&nbsp;Recently, venture capital activities of various companies have shown signs of further acceleration.&nbsp;In June 2018,&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;andBoeing&nbsp;invested in two&nbsp;and&nbsp;three start-ups, respectively, both hitting a new monthly high,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Loma announced that it would double its venture capital fund.</p>

<p>I. Analysis of the motivation of foreign&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturers to carry out venture capital</p>

<p>Compared with the information industry where venture capital is prevalent, the&nbsp;aviationindustry has the characteristics of high threshold, high risk&nbsp;and&nbsp;high investment. It is subject to strict safety supervision&nbsp;and&nbsp;is therefore conservative in major investment in&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;manufacturing.&nbsp;Today, with the rapid development of emerging technologies&nbsp;andindustries, subversion, cross-border, integration&nbsp;and&nbsp;penetration have become new trends. Frontier subversive technologies such as artificial intelligence, hypersonic,&nbsp;andintelligent manufacturing will open up a new pattern for the development of&nbsp;aviationtechnology in the future, transforming the traditional Scientific research production mode.&nbsp;At the same time, the pattern of technological&nbsp;innovation&nbsp;is also undergoing profound changes. Innovative small enterprises with unique technological advantages have emerged in large numbers. Large high-tech companies such as Google&nbsp;and&nbsp;Intel have eroded the territory of traditional&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturers through products such as drones&nbsp;and&nbsp;all-electric&nbsp;aircraft.&nbsp;In response to the challenges, foreign large-scale&nbsp;aerospacemanufacturing companies are focusing on the new round of key areas of technology&nbsp;andindustrial change, strengthening the ability to identify, acquire&nbsp;and&nbsp;transform emerging technologies,&nbsp;and&nbsp;using venture capital as a way to tap external&nbsp;innovation, seek technology&nbsp;or&nbsp;disruptive&nbsp;innovation&nbsp;in business models. An important means of opportunity to seize the opportunities for future development.</p>

<p>2. Overview of venture capital investment of major foreign&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturers</p>

<p>Since 2015, venture capital has become popular among large&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturers.&nbsp;Aviation&nbsp;manufacturing giants such as Safran,&nbsp;Airbus,&nbsp;Boeing&nbsp;and&nbsp;Loma have established venture capital institutions.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;Safran Ventures</p>

<p>Safran Group established a&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;venture capital company in May 2015,&nbsp;andinvested 50 million euros in initial funding within three years to provide funding for start-ups that have developed breakthrough, disruptive technologies or new business models to &ldquo;help the peak response&rdquo;. The challenges facing the&nbsp;aerospace, defense&nbsp;and&nbsp;security markets reflect Safran&#39;s&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;strategy based on&nbsp;innovation&nbsp;and&nbsp;change.&nbsp;Areas of interest include advanced materials, robotics, new manufacturing processes, network sensors&nbsp;and&nbsp;their data analysis, machine/vehicle&nbsp;systems&nbsp;for&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;and&nbsp;other vehicles,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Internet of Things solutions.&nbsp;So far, a total of five companies have been invested (list), with security&nbsp;services, augmented reality, additive manufacturing, computer chips&nbsp;and&nbsp;photonic solutions.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;Ventures</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;Group established a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley in May 2015&nbsp;andestablished offices in Paris, France&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tokyo, Japan.&nbsp;With an initial investment of US$150 million, it invests in &ldquo;disruptive&nbsp;innovation&rdquo; technology on a global scale.&nbsp;His areas of focus include smart manufacturing&nbsp;and&nbsp;smart factories, urban&nbsp;air&nbsp;traffic&nbsp;andautomated&nbsp;aircraft, artificial intelligence, new energy&nbsp;and&nbsp;aerospace.&nbsp;So far, a total of 17 companies have been invested (list),&nbsp;and&nbsp;their main businesses include smart manufacturing, industrial software, quantum computing, airspace management,&nbsp;autonomous&nbsp;systems, smart sensors, Internet of Things, drones, space debris detection&nbsp;and&nbsp;protection.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;Loma Ventures</p>

<p>Loma set up a venture capital firm in June 2016 with a focus on&nbsp;autonomous&nbsp;systemsand&nbsp;robotics, network security, space technology, advanced communications&nbsp;andsensors, underwater technology, data analysis, artificial intelligence&nbsp;and&nbsp;machine learning,&nbsp;and&nbsp;next generation. Avionics, advanced materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;manufacturing, energy&nbsp;and&nbsp;power&nbsp;systems.&nbsp;So far, a total of five companies have been invested (list), with the main business being artificial intelligence,&nbsp;autonomous&nbsp;systems, industrial software, advanced communications&nbsp;and&nbsp;sensors,&nbsp;and&nbsp;unmanned submersibles.&nbsp;In June 2018, affected by the large-scale tax cuts of the US federal government, Loma announced that it would double its venture capital fund to reach $200 million.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;Boeing&nbsp;Horizon X Ventures</p>

<p>Boeing&nbsp;established HorizonX Venture Capital in April 2017. It has&nbsp;more than&nbsp;30employees&nbsp;and&nbsp;is divided into three groups:&nbsp;venture capital&nbsp;, new business&nbsp;anddisruptive. They are responsible for finding start-ups&nbsp;and&nbsp;providing funds. The market introduces new capabilities, introduces existing capabilities into new markets,&nbsp;and&nbsp;looks for opportunities outside of traditional commerce.&nbsp;The company has an average annual investment of tens of millions of dollars. So far, it has invested in 14 companies (list). Its main business involves hypersonic, advanced materials, additive manufacturing, augmented reality, satellite communications, driverless, artificial intelligence. , hybrid, cargo drones&nbsp;and&nbsp;other fields.</p>

<p>Third, the main characteristics of foreign&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturers venture capital</p>

<p>In view of the recent venture capital activities of&nbsp;Boeing,&nbsp;Airbus, Loma&nbsp;and&nbsp;Safran, the four major&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturers have the following characteristics.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;Investment targets focus on high-tech, high-potential start-ups</p>

<p>All&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturers focus on investing in start-ups with new technologies, new materials&nbsp;or&nbsp;new&nbsp;services, high-tech&nbsp;and&nbsp;high-growth characteristics,&nbsp;and&nbsp;their scientific&nbsp;and&nbsp;technological achievements are mostly in the early stage of the transition from laboratories to industrialization.&nbsp;In addition, the management team&nbsp;and&nbsp;management process of the investment object are also important considerations.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;The investment field is closely linked to the future&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;business upgrade</p>

<p>The main investment fields of various&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturers can be summarized into six aspects: First, technologies that represent the future development direction of&nbsp;aviationtechnology, such as electric&nbsp;aircraft, hypersonic flight,&nbsp;and&nbsp;autonomous&nbsp;systems; second, technologies related to improving production efficiency, such as additive manufacturing. , augmented reality, smart factories, etc.; third, key basic products, such as advanced materials, special chips, smart sensors, industrial software, etc.; Fourth, related technologies to enhance user experience, such as&nbsp;air&nbsp;Internet, satellite communications, Internet of Things, etc.; Future&nbsp;air&nbsp;traffic vehicles, such as flying taxis, cargo drones, etc.; six are new business models, such as&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;to explore&nbsp;helicopter-like on-demand service&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;Uber&nbsp;.&nbsp;These areas are closely related to the core business development of&nbsp;aerospace&nbsp;manufacturers.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;Investment mode follows the mode of VC investment</p>

<p>All&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturers&#39; venture capital companies operate in accordance with the modern high-tech industry venture capital investment mode, follow the risk investment approach,&nbsp;and&nbsp;join the companies in the lead, investment&nbsp;or&nbsp;investment mode, participate in the start-up A, B&nbsp;or&nbsp;C rounds. Financing, a single investment amount is in the range of hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;Investment objectives are more focused on the benefits of future development</p>

<p>Venture capital does not aim at controlling the company, but gains profits through equity appreciation.&nbsp;Compared with&nbsp;general&nbsp;risk capital, which values ??short-term high profits&nbsp;and&nbsp;high returns,&nbsp;aerospace&nbsp;manufacturers pay more attention to benefiting from the future development of technology,&nbsp;and&nbsp;establish long-term strategic partnership with investment objects, through its strong research&nbsp;and&nbsp;technical resources, rich Engineering experience&nbsp;and&nbsp;a large supply chain system drive the development of start-ups.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;Management mode chooses according to its own situation</p>

<p>First, the affiliation of the venture capital departments of various&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturers is different. The venture capital companies of&nbsp;Boeing, Loma&nbsp;and&nbsp;Safran belong to the subordinate departments or subsidiaries of the group. The&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;venture capital company is an independent venture capital fund with independent operations. right.&nbsp;The second is to select management based on actual conditions on the premise of emphasizing specialization.&nbsp;Airbus, Loma&nbsp;and&nbsp;Safran hired experienced professional venture capitalists as CEOs, while&nbsp;Boeing&nbsp;appointed the CEO of Insitu UAV, which it acquired, to lead the venture capital arm.</p>

<p>6.&nbsp;Investment decisions are supported by professional institutions</p>

<p>Due to the uncertainties faced by start-ups, the project failure rate&nbsp;and&nbsp;market elimination rate are high,&nbsp;and&nbsp;venture capital must be accompanied by a large investment risk.&nbsp;In this regard, each company&#39;s venture capital department has professional institutions&nbsp;orbusiness departments to provide decision&nbsp;support&nbsp;for its venture capital activities.&nbsp;For example, the&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;A3 Silicon Valley Technology&nbsp;and&nbsp;Business&nbsp;Innovation&nbsp;Center is responsible for providing professional technical knowledge&nbsp;and&nbsp;investment risk assessment for the investment activities of&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;Venture Capital.</p>

<p>Fourth, the revelation suggestion</p>

<p>The intensive venture capital activities of foreign&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturing giants in recent years reflect that the strategic competition for future technological&nbsp;innovation&nbsp;is unprecedentedly fierce,&nbsp;and&nbsp;they are trying to maintain their leading position in the rapid transformation of&nbsp;aviation.&nbsp;At present, venture capital is very active in China&#39;s Internet +, sharing economy, big data, cloud computing, new media&nbsp;and&nbsp;other industries,&nbsp;and&nbsp;has become an important catalyst for China&#39;s new economic development,&nbsp;and&nbsp;continues to extend to traditional industries.&nbsp;In line with the development trend at home&nbsp;and&nbsp;abroad, China&#39;s&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;industry should also pay attention to the application of venture capital in the industry.</p>

<p>First, aiming at the long-term development needs of&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;weapons&nbsp;and&nbsp;equipment in the future, aiming at the development trend of&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;technology,&nbsp;and&nbsp;exploring the use of venture capital as an important means to promote the deep development of&nbsp;military-civilian integration, establish a diversified technology investment mechanism,&nbsp;and&nbsp;build an open collaborative&nbsp;innovation&nbsp;system.&nbsp;Combining risky investment means with excellent social&nbsp;innovation&nbsp;resources to make up for their own research power can not cover the shortcomings of cutting-edge subversive technological&nbsp;innovation&nbsp;hotspots, strategically deploy future&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;technology, products&nbsp;and&nbsp;business models,&nbsp;andfoster new economic growth points.</p>

<p>Second, considering the differences in&nbsp;innovation&nbsp;environments at home&nbsp;and&nbsp;abroad, domestic venture capital should pay more attention to business model&nbsp;innovation&nbsp;andtechnology-driven start-ups.&nbsp;In the current situation where China&#39;s technology-driven start-ups are difficult to compete with the US&nbsp;and&nbsp;Europe in terms of quantity&nbsp;and&nbsp;quality, they should actively&nbsp;plan&nbsp;with a global perspective&nbsp;and&nbsp;invest in foreign outstanding&nbsp;innovation&nbsp;resources within the scope permitted by domestic&nbsp;and&nbsp;foreign policies&nbsp;andregulations.&nbsp;If conditions are met, participate in financing activities of foreign technology start-ups with international&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturers.</p>

<p>Third, while improving strategic vision&nbsp;and&nbsp;market vision, we attach great importance to risk management&nbsp;and&nbsp;risk assessment.&nbsp;At present, domestic venture capital has promoted a bubble tendency under the continuous high capital boom,&nbsp;and&nbsp;start-ups are mixed.&nbsp;We should carefully analyze&nbsp;and&nbsp;carefully identify the potential value of innovative SMEs&nbsp;and&nbsp;their scientific&nbsp;and&nbsp;technological achievements,&nbsp;and&nbsp;select investment objects that have unique technological advantages, high growth potential&nbsp;and&nbsp;synergy with the core business of the&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;industry, reduce investment risks&nbsp;and&nbsp;improve investment returns.</p>",Commercial,Neutral

(Machine Translated from Chinese)</p>,"<p>The 200 million Italian AW189 helicopter was transported into Hall 4 of the National Convention and Exhibition Center. The process was &ldquo;hard and domineering&rdquo;. News reporter Yu Kai was given a picture of the respondent&nbsp;as the first China International Import Expo smart and high-end equipment exhibition area aerospace fine The AZ189, the most expensive exhibit in the sub-district area, was successfully transported to the National Exhibition Center at Hall 4.1H on the morning of October 28th.</p>

<p>The inter-American people who brought the aircraft to Shanghai to participate in the news (www.thepaper.cn) revealed that in order to ensure the safe transportation process, three cars were dispatched this morning last night to load the AW189. Large logistics vehicles serve as &ldquo;escorts&rdquo;.&nbsp;On the morning of October 28th, the most expensive helicopter finally passed the 4.5km high National Exhibition Center West Square, slowly and smoothly entered the 4.1H pavilion, and began the final assembly and installation work.</p>

<p>The AW189 is the latest high-performance super mid-size twin-engine helicopter with a maximum take-off weight of 8.6 tons and two GE CT7-2E1 high-power turboshaft engines with FADEC.&nbsp;The cabin can be used for up to 20 people, with a maximum cruising speed of 287 km/h, maximum fuel consumption of over 2 tons and maximum range of over 1000 km.&nbsp;At the same time, the AW189 is equipped with a vitrified, integrated and open avionics system that greatly enhances situational awareness, effectively reducing pilot workload and optimizing the efficiency of performing tasks.</p>

<p>According to a person from Leonardo Helicopter, the AW189 meets the latest Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency&#39;s 29 most stringent safety standards, and has the world&#39;s strongest 50-minute final drive dry-running capability. It fully guarantees the safety requirements for its search and rescue operations and offshore oil operations.</p>

<p>Up to now, AW189 has sold more than 150 aircraft worldwide, nearly 60 of which are in active service, with a cumulative total of more than 35,000 flight hours. It is the most successful super medium-sized commercial helicopter in the world.&nbsp;AW189&#39;s operators include offshore oil operators Bristo, ERA, CHC, Bel-Air, Weststar, VNH, etc., while AW189 performs maritime search and rescue missions in the UK and the Malvinas Islands, in South Korea, Tokyo, Japan. Malaysia performs fire fighting tasks.</p>

<p>The Italian Leonardo helicopter AW189 flew from Malaysia to Shenzhen, China on October 17 and began to embark on the final &ldquo;journey&rdquo; to Shanghai.&nbsp;Shenzhen is the first stop for transportation to Shanghai. After that, it stopped and stopped for several stops, replenished fuel, and finally arrived at the designated place in Shanghai, and then checked it to the exhibition area.</p>

<p>Since the National Convention and Exhibition Center, where the main venue of the Import Expo is located, is a no-fly zone, the AW189 helicopter will be used for land transfer. It will fly from Shenzhen to Shanghai Gaodong Helicopter Airport and then fly from Gaodong Airport to Shanghai Hawke. The Pacific Business Aviation Center will then be disassembled and re-assembled in the Progress Hall.</p>

<p>The Leonardo helicopters in Italy have three models to participate in the import fair in Shanghai, namely AW189, AW139 and AW119Kx. The latter two models have been sold in China, so the exhibits are also much more convenient to transport than the AW189. After Wuxi flew to Shanghai, it transferred to the transportation progress hall; the other was in Shanghai, and the transit to the transportation progress hall.</p>

<p>According to relevant Interamerican sources, in addition to the AW189 arrived today, another model of the AW139 helicopter will be loaded at Shanghai Gaodong Helicopter Airport at around 14:30 pm on October 28th. If the loading is progressing smoothly, the evening will be It will also arrive at the Qingpu National Convention and Exhibition Center.At the same time, the Leonardo helicopters, including the AW189, will be statically displayed at the Immortal Company booth at the Import Expo from November 5th to 10th.</p>",Commercial,Positive

From the published video, there was no problem with the helicopter hovering, but after rising to a certain height, the fuselage Suddenly began to spin, eventually losing control and falling rapidly. (Machine Translated from Chinese)</p>","<p>Recently, the video of the private helicopter crash of the Leicester City boss Wichi guessed, and aviation experts guessed the cause of the crash.</p>

<p>Vicky was riding the Agusta-Westland AW169 twin-engine 10-seat helicopter. From the published video, there was no problem with the helicopter hovering, but after rising to a certain height, the fuselage Suddenly began to spin, eventually losing control and falling rapidly.</p>

<p>After watching the video of the crash, aviation expert David Lilmont talked about his view of the crash. &quot;The helicopter does not see any abnormality during the launch, but flying off the court is a troublesome operation because In general, you need some speed of advancement and continue to climb, but after the pilots climbed vertically above the height of the stadium, they made a move to prepare for the turn and then lost control of the aircraft.&quot;</p>

<p>David Lilmont thought that the helicopter&#39;s lateral rotor was likely to have encountered a fault, which was the main cause of the air crash. &quot;The lateral rotor failure will cause the aircraft to lose thrust and then fall quickly. In this case, The pilot should return the side rotor to the neutral state as quickly as possible, and then turn off the power as soon as possible to ensure that the rotor rotates and the helicopter enters the taxiing state.&quot;</p>

<p>To make such an emergency operation, the premise is that the flight altitude is high enough, but the height of the helicopter may not be enough, causing the pilot to fail to make emergency operations in time, David Lilmont said, &ldquo;Once the fuselage begins.

The Road to Rebirth of ""Super Puma""",,QQ.com,"According to the US ""Robo Report"" reported on October 3, Airbus Helicopter Company tried to persuade all regulators to introduce ""Super Puma"" and promised them that the safety performance of the aircraft has been perfected and can be completely continued. (Machine Translated from Chinese)","<p>According to the US &quot;Robo Report&quot; reported on October 3, Airbus Helicopter Company tried to persuade all regulators to introduce &quot;Super Puma&quot; and promised them that the safety performance of the aircraft has been perfected and can be completely continued. work. But the company&#39;s major customers, such as most oil and gas producers, say they have no intention of introducing the &quot;super jaguar&quot; in the future , and not even one H225 to resume operations in the fringe of the northeastern Atlantic.</p>

<p>The reason for these attitudes is probably because of the accident:</p>

<p>On April 29, 2016, an H225 Airbus helicopter (LN-OJF) crashed in an accident in Norway. The transmission failed during the flight, causing the main rotor blade of the Super Puma to be completely separated from the main body of the aircraft. All 13 people on board were killed.</p>

<p>After the price of crude oil plummeted</p>

<p>A brutal oil and gas crisis has taken place. About 71% of the civilian H225 fleet (122 aircraft) are engaged in offshore oil and gas operations, most of which are in the marginal waters of the northeastern Atlantic. At the time, the H225 accounted for 40% of the modern heavy-duty helicopter offshore market. After the flight, its main competitor Sikorsky S-92, as well as some smaller new generation helicopters (mainly H175 and Leonardo) The AW189 helicopter) began to replace it.</p>

<p>Given the slow recovery of the oil and gas industry, even without H225, the market is still trapped in overcapacity , and this dilemma is expected to continue for some time.</p>

<p><strong>Excessive inventory</strong></p>

<p>In fact, helicopter operators have realized that these redundant H225 aircraft are no longer needed in the oil and gas business. This can be seen from the slow recovery of service, as by July 2017, when the aircraft was finally cleared on the Norwegian and British lists, 85% of the fleet was still being stored. Since CHC filed a bankruptcy protection application under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Law and received a lease return, 42% of the fleet is in the hands of the bank or the leasing company.</p>

<p>This problem has existed in the past, and it is still grim now. The focus of the issue is mainly on the customer, and especially the passengers&#39; perception of safety, but Norwegian investigators have been unable to determine exactly what caused the main gearbox to crack .</p>

<p><strong>Future market forecast</strong></p>

<p>The latest peak in 2014 shows that the global maritime support fleet now has a total of 1980 rotorcraft, which has increased to 356 since 2008, as new and more efficient aircraft enter the market, coincident with oil production and exploration activities. Increasing.</p>

<p>But the plunge in oil prices has caused oil companies to cut costs, and the helicopter fleet has suffered huge losses; since reaching its peak in 2014, the number of active helicopters has fallen by 14% (or 280 helicopters) and, in terms of current sales prospects Its usage rate has dropped significantly .</p>

<p>Ascend predicts that a total of 8,350 civilian turbo helicopters will be delivered over the next 10 years, for a total value of $46 billion. At present, there are 26,000 turbo helicopters in the world that are about to retire, and will purchase more than half of the helicopters. Ascend&#39;s data shows that 70% of aircraft have been in service for 30 years, &quot; so there is now a large fleet that can be replaced. &quot;</p>

<p>From a regional perspective, Asia Pacific&#39;s delivery in the next 10 years should account for 33%, more than 26% in North America. Europe will account for 23% and Latin America for 10%. However, North America will retain the largest fleet, accounting for 34% of the total 2027 fleet. Ascend expects Airbus to lead the market with 37% delivery and 44% value.</p>

<p>H225&#39;s experience shows how quickly it can adapt to a downturn in the market, whether it has a keen insight . Although the H225&#39;s redundant, surplus fleet may take some time to be digested by the market, in the past few months, we have seen them gradually recover from the depressed market.</p>

The first three helicopters will be delivered between 2019 and 2020.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dutch people rely on the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) we offer in partnership with four university hospitals, and we believe the H135 helicopter is the best choice for this task,&rdquo; said Petra van Saaze, Director of Medical Air Assistance at ANWB.&nbsp;Helionix will help us strengthen our 24/7 operational capabilities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are grateful to ANWB for its trust in Airbus helicopters, especially for the H135.&rdquo; Thomas Hein, head of sales for Airbus Helicopters West Europe, said, &ldquo;The H135 is a modern, modern reference for airborne rescue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>ANWB Medical Air Assistance is wholly owned by the Royal Dutch Travel Club ANWB. It is the only helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) operator in the Netherlands, performing more than 8,500 missions per year and operating six H135 series helicopters.&nbsp;Relying on helicopters, ANWB serves four trauma centers in the Netherlands 24 hours a day, seven days a week.&nbsp;ANWB plans to implement fleet updates with the new H135 helicopter to meet the latest technical standards.&nbsp;In addition, ANWB operates two H145 helicopters and works with local ambulance service providers to perform more than 600 air ambulance missions each year for the Dutch Wadden Islands.</p>

<p>H135 is the benchmark in the global HEMS field.&nbsp;It combines a spacious, barrier-free cabin with outstanding performance, range and payload capabilities, and low noise operation.&nbsp;The oversized sliding side door and flip-top rear door allow for quick loading and unloading of patients.&nbsp;At the same time, Airbus&#39; iconic ducted tail rotor provides additional safety in ground operations.</p>

<p>In addition to the 4-axis autopilot, the Helionix avionics system provides an innovative cockpit layout that helps improve situational awareness.&nbsp;The H135 helicopter is designed with three large electronic displays, the cockpit is compatible with night vision goggles and is equipped with a first limit indicator that displays the pilot&#39;s corresponding engine gauge data in an indicator.</p>

<p>The sixth frame begins in the green assembly</p>

<p>Different from&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;aviation,&nbsp;general&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;is flexible, fast&nbsp;and&nbsp;efficient,&nbsp;and&nbsp;is a symbolic industry in&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;countries.&nbsp;Medical ambulances, meteorological observations, aerial inspections, aerial photography, marine surveillance,&nbsp;and&nbsp;private&nbsp;jets all fall into the category of&nbsp;general&nbsp;aviation.</p>

<p>Compared with European&nbsp;and&nbsp;American countries, China&#39;s navigation&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;is not only a small number, but also has a gap in manufacturing.&nbsp;In the United States, for example, more than 250,000&nbsp;general&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;are registered with the FAA (United States Federal&nbsp;Aviation&nbsp;Administration), while there are only a few thousand in the country.&nbsp;The&nbsp;general&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;industry has great potential for development&nbsp;and&nbsp;has a strong driving force for economic development&nbsp;and&nbsp;transformation&nbsp;and&nbsp;upgrading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The navigation industry is still in its infancy in China, which is equivalent to starting from scratch. But it also means that the entire market is very large. Some experts believe that the navigation industry is another trillion-level emerging industry.&rdquo; Qingdao United&nbsp;General&nbsp;Aviation&nbsp;Industry Development Co., Ltd.&nbsp;General&nbsp;Manager Su Qinglin said.</p>

<p>Take the&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;Qingdao H135&nbsp;helicopter&nbsp;assembly line project undertaken by Qingdao United Airlines Co., Ltd. as an example. The project aims to meet the development goals of gathering&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;talents, integrating navigation resources, improving manufacturing level, promoting industrial agglomeration&nbsp;and&nbsp;deepening international cooperation. The construction of the ecosystem&nbsp;andthe establishment of the peninsula&nbsp;helicopter&nbsp;application demonstration system will carry the mission of developing the&nbsp;general&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;industry in Qingdao, re-engineering the Qingdao billion-dollar industrial chain,&nbsp;and&nbsp;assisting the transformation&nbsp;and&nbsp;upgrading of regional industries.</p>

<p>Su Qinglin introduced: &quot;This project has filled the gap of 3 tons of navigable&nbsp;helicopters&nbsp;in China. Next we will base on the H135 assembly line to develop R&amp;D&nbsp;and&nbsp;design upstream of the navigation industry, as well as downstream manufacturing, operation, sales,&nbsp;training, etc. The agglomeration effect has made the navigation industry in Qingdao&nbsp;andShandong bigger and stronger.&quot;</p>

<p>The Qingdao assembly line was jointly funded by&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;Helicopter&nbsp;Company&nbsp;and&nbsp;China. It is the first H135&nbsp;helicopter&nbsp;assembly line established by&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;Helicopter&nbsp;Company outside Europe. The total investment is about 100 million Euros&nbsp;and&nbsp;a total of 100 orders are underwritten.&nbsp;The final assembly line will be completed&nbsp;and&nbsp;delivered by the end of this year. It is expected to be officially operated at the beginning of next year. It will maintain the same quality, the same technical level&nbsp;and&nbsp;the same service standard as the assembly line of the Danubewater base in Germany, with a design capacity of 36 units/year.</p>

<p>&quot;The first five of the&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;Qingdao H135&nbsp;helicopters&nbsp;will be completed by the Chinese&nbsp;and&nbsp;foreign technical workers at the German base. From the sixth, they will be completely assembled in the Qingdao base.&quot; Su Qinglin said that the first batch of 20 technicians have already been in Donauworth, Germany. After more than half a year of&nbsp;training, I began to return&nbsp;and&nbsp;prepare for the start of the production line.&nbsp;There will be no problem with talents until next year.</p>

<p>These technicians are from Shandong and Guangzhou, Harbin, Hebei and other places. They all have experience in technical positions in&nbsp;aerospace, locomotive, ship&nbsp;and&nbsp;other related industries,&nbsp;and&nbsp;many have had experience in foreign&nbsp;training&nbsp;and&nbsp;work.&nbsp;According to the requirements of the&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;Helicopter&nbsp;Assembly, they are located in important positions such as avionics, electrical, testing&nbsp;and&nbsp;assembly.</p>

<p>Layout&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;medical rescue system</p>

<p>The&nbsp;general&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;industry chain is huge,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the economic pull effect is obvious. It involves not only the development&nbsp;and&nbsp;manufacture of key components such as airborne equipment, engines&nbsp;and&nbsp;avionics equipment, but also&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;and&nbsp;modification,&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;training&nbsp;and&nbsp;other projects.&nbsp;It can be said that the&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;Qingdao H135&nbsp;helicopter&nbsp;assembly line is an icebreaker in the development of the&nbsp;generalaviation&nbsp;industry in Qingdao.</p>

<p>But the problem of light to solve manufacturing does not mean that the plane can go to heaven&nbsp;and&nbsp;land smoothly.&nbsp;&quot;Automobiles go to 4S stores&nbsp;and&nbsp;buy them at any time. Roads, parking lots,&nbsp;and&nbsp;gas stations are all ready-made. However, the navigation of&nbsp;helicoptersrequires airspace approval,&nbsp;and&nbsp;there are infrastructures for landing. Many conditions are not available.&quot; Su Qinglin believes that navigation The industry involves the opening of low-altitude airspace and the planning and construction of&nbsp;general-purpose airports. It must not only &ldquo;make it out&nbsp;and&nbsp;sell it&rdquo;, but also &ldquo;float&nbsp;and&nbsp;fall down&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;medical rescue system in developed countries has long matured.&nbsp;For example, German&nbsp;helicopters&nbsp;can reach the accident site in any part of the country within 15 minutes. The annual rescue mission is more than 100,000 times. In most parts of the United States, 20-minute&nbsp;helicopter&nbsp;rescue service is guaranteed. There are&nbsp;30&nbsp;professional&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;medical rescue companies.The&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;medical rescue system in developed countries has long matured.&nbsp;For example, a German&nbsp;helicopter&nbsp;can reach an accident site in any part of the country within 15 minutes. The annual rescue mission is more than 100,000 times. In most parts of the United States, 20-minute&nbsp;helicopter&nbsp;rescue service is guaranteed. There are more than&nbsp;300 professional&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;medical rescue companies. .</p>

<p>The breakthrough point selected by Qingdao United Airlines Co., Ltd. is also in the field of&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;medical rescue,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the demonstration system of&nbsp;helicopter&nbsp;application led by&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;medical rescue is based on Qingdao, facing Shandong and radiating the whole country.&nbsp;Su Qinglin told reporters: &quot;The biggest feature of&nbsp;helicopters&nbsp;is that they have fast response speed&nbsp;and&nbsp;have advantages in special terrains such as snow mountains. We also want to learn from the mature model in Europe&nbsp;and&nbsp;America, apply medical rescue&nbsp;helicopters&nbsp;first, establish a model in Qingdao&nbsp;and&nbsp;even Shandong, and then Promoted throughout the country.&quot;</p>

<p>The cost of medical rescue&nbsp;helicopters&nbsp;is relatively high. Qingdao United Airlines will now seek government procurement&nbsp;services&nbsp;to&nbsp;support&nbsp;helicoptermedical rescue applications. Later, with the market growth, medical insurance&nbsp;and&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;insurance will be introduced,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;helicopter&nbsp;medical rescue operation mode applicable to China will gradually be formed.&nbsp;&quot;The German medical rescue&nbsp;helicopter&nbsp;system is very mature, but they have also used it for&nbsp;30&nbsp;years to establish this system. We are confident to learn from foreign experience&nbsp;and&nbsp;combine our national conditions, so that the H135&nbsp;helicopter&nbsp;made by Qingdao will fly as soon as possible, so that the people can enjoy the&nbsp;helicopter.

<p>A new generation of carrier rocket family collective appearance</p>

<p>At this year&#39;s&nbsp;air&nbsp;show, China&nbsp;Aerospace&nbsp;Science&nbsp;and&nbsp;Technology Group Co., Ltd. will bring the latest scientific&nbsp;and&nbsp;technological achievements in the past two years, a total of 184 products will be exhibited. Among them, the new generation carrier rocket family will make its first collective appearance with the 1:10 model.</p>

<p>Nearly ten types of carrier rockets, independently developed by the China&nbsp;Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (referred to as &ldquo;Aerospace&nbsp;First Institute&rdquo;), represented by the Long March series, not only diversified in structure&nbsp;and&nbsp;function, but also in-track accuracy&nbsp;and&nbsp;effectiveness. Key indicators such as load factor, carrying capacity&nbsp;and adaptability have reached international standards, and have also entered the forefront of the world in terms of frequency of transmission and success rate of launch.</p>

<p>Among the new generation of launch vehicle families, the Long March 11 solid launch vehicle (referred to as the &quot;Long Eleven Rocket&quot;) is the only solid model in China&#39;s new generation of launch vehicles. In recent years, its performance has been particularly dazzling&nbsp;and&nbsp;attracting attention.&nbsp;Jin Xin, deputy director of the Chang 11 rocket, said that compared with the other brothers of the &quot;Long March Family&quot;, the Chang 11 rocket is not a &quot;big man&quot;. The diameter of the arrow is only 2 meters, but the energy contained is huge.</p>

<p>According to reports, since the solid&nbsp;fuel&nbsp;is filled in the rocket in advance, it can be stored for a long time, eliminating the process of&nbsp;fuel&nbsp;filling before the liquid rocket is launched, so that the preparation time of the long eleven rockets is shortened from several months to several days,&nbsp;and&nbsp;multiple pieces can be taken at one time. The satellite is sent to heaven.&nbsp;&quot;This not only greatly improved the reliability of the rocket, but also further reduced the preparation for launch testing, coupled with the ability to quickly dock with a variety of satellites, so that the shortest launch preparation time of the Chang 11 rocket broke through the 24-hour mark&nbsp;and&nbsp;became the world. One of the launch vehicles with the shortest launch time,&quot; Jin Xin said.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that, previously, Zhuhai Obit&nbsp;Aerospace&nbsp;Technology Co., Ltd. developed&nbsp;and&nbsp;produced the &quot;Zhuhai No. 1&quot; 02 group of satellites that were &quot;sent&quot; into space by the Chang 11 rocket.&nbsp;At the beginning of this year, the Chang 11 rocket completed the &quot;one arrow&nbsp;and&nbsp;six stars&quot; launch mission in the first full&nbsp;commercial launch. In April next year, the Chang 11 rocket will conduct the first sea launch test.</p>

<p>At the current&nbsp;air&nbsp;show, in addition to bringing a new generation of carrier rocket family models to the audience, the First&nbsp;Aerospace&nbsp;Institute will also launch new&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;rockets at the&nbsp;air&nbsp;show site&nbsp;and&nbsp;launch a series of trades.

<p>According to He Guosheng, deputy director of the Department of Business&nbsp;and Investment of the First Affiliation Institute, the three robots that will be unveiled are intelligent security robots, teaching robots,&nbsp;and&nbsp;industrial exoskeleton robots.</p>

<p>The control system is the &quot;nerve center&quot; of the rocket. It can make the rocket &quot;sound&quot; in flight, control hundreds of thousands of components to work, fly according to the scheduled route, make prescribed actions at the specified position, and can respond according to the situation. Turn and move.</p>

<p>Using this technology,&nbsp;Aerospace&nbsp;Institute has developed an intelligent security robot.&nbsp;After joining the&nbsp;aerospace&nbsp;&quot;wisdom&quot;, this robot can autonomously avoid obstacles, state &quot;self-detection, cloud monitoring&quot;, protect&nbsp;customer&nbsp;data&nbsp;and&nbsp;rights,&nbsp;and&nbsp;realize rapid discovery&nbsp;and&nbsp;positioning when abnormal conditions occur.</p>

<p>The research&nbsp;and&nbsp;development of industrial exoskeleton robots is aimed at the fields of mechanical manufacturing, express logistics operations, post-disaster emergency rescue&nbsp;and&nbsp;medical rehabilitation, etc., which have high requirements for individual operation ability but cannot use automation equipment.&nbsp;Aerospace&nbsp;First&nbsp;Academy researchers rely on&nbsp;aerospace&nbsp;high-power electromechanical Actuated technology&nbsp;and energy management technology, integrated into the lightweight&nbsp;and&nbsp;modular design&nbsp;concept&nbsp;of the&nbsp;aerospace&nbsp;system, the robot has a weight of 25 kg, which can help the operator to carry a long distance&nbsp;and&nbsp;multi-terrain walking with a load of 60 kg&nbsp;and&nbsp;a distance of 4 km per hour. operation.</p>

<p>The teaching robot adopts the semi-physical simulation teaching system of the loop in the loop by the system supporting robot controller, which fully satisfies the needs of the university virtual combination data analysis.</p>

(Machine Translated from Chinese),"<p>The executives broke away from the tide&nbsp;and&nbsp;the scandals of corruption continued. After a series of successive shocks, the European&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;manufacturing giant&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;(hereafter referred to as&nbsp;Airbus) finally identified its new successor.&nbsp;On Monday,&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;issued a statement saying that it will appoint its head of&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;manufacturing business, Tom Fu Li, as the next CEO,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the turmoil that lasted for months in the leadership of Europe&#39;s largest&nbsp;aerospace&nbsp;group has come to an end.&nbsp;At the same time, however, the stagnation of the &ldquo;discontinuation crisis&rdquo;&nbsp;and&nbsp;the guise that affects delivery have always been constant. After serious internal friction, people can&rsquo;t help wondering how Fu Li will clean up the mess.</p>

<p>01</p>

<p>Faury&#39;s succession is very timely.&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;said in a statement that the 50-year-old Frenchman will replace the current CEO Tom Enders from Germany at the next&nbsp;general&nbsp;meeting in April 2019.&nbsp;At the end of last year,&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;announced the departure decision of Enders,&nbsp;and&nbsp;a year before the decision was made, a Reuters report pointed out that Enders was investigated by the Austrian judicial department because of the 2003&nbsp;Airbus. Airmail was allegedly &quot;fraud&nbsp;and&nbsp;corruption&quot; in a&nbsp;military&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;order, but&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;explicitly denied it.</p>

<p>The announcement shows that Fu Li will continue to address industrial technology issues affecting the delivery of some jets, while overseeing the manufacture of smaller but more&nbsp;autonomous&nbsp;helicopters&nbsp;and&nbsp;defense facilities.&nbsp;People familiar with the matter said that his current position will not be replaced, but this does not rule out involvement in operational management, as two top industry executives are preparing to retire at the end of this year.&nbsp;In addition,&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;also announced that the company&#39;s chairman Dennis Lanke will step down in 2020, the board of directors will start to choose new in due course according to the principle of &ldquo;maintaining the importance of internationalization&nbsp;and&nbsp;diversification of board&nbsp;andmanagement&rdquo; mentioned in the internal regulations. Chairman.&nbsp;Some analysts believe that this means that Toray&#39;s appointment may indicate that the board of directors will undergo tremendous changes.</p>

<p>In fact, Fu Li&#39;s success is not just a simple appointment, which is more complicated than Enders&#39; departure.&nbsp;It is understood that at the end of last year, in the power struggle with Enders,&nbsp;Airbus&rsquo;s second-in-command chief operating officer and civil&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;president Fabri Blyley announced that he would resign in February 2018,&nbsp;and&nbsp;then Fu Li was appointed as Head of the core&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;manufacturing business.&nbsp;It was this reorganization that allowed Enders to opt out of the 2019&nbsp;plan&nbsp;to seek a third term.</p>

<p>The top layer of&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;has had problems inside.&nbsp;It is understood that although Enders&nbsp;and&nbsp;Blyley are important big names&nbsp;and&nbsp;second-handers in&nbsp;Airbus, their relationship is not harmonious.&nbsp;A Reuters report pointed out that Enders asked the sales team of&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;civilian&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;to bypass Blye directly to pay back,&nbsp;and&nbsp;this became the confirmation that Enders wanted to gain more power in the group.</p>

<p>The struggle between Enders&nbsp;and&nbsp;Blyley is just the tip of the iceberg in the loose upper level of&nbsp;Airbus.&nbsp;In the past September,&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;re-announced personnel changes, saying that Eric Schultz, who served as the company&#39;s chief&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;officer for nine months, left the company for &quot;personal reasons&quot;&nbsp;and&nbsp;has previously served as an&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;substation turboprop regional&nbsp;aircraft. Christian Scherer, head of the&nbsp;joint&nbsp;venture ATR, was immediately appointed as the successor to Eric Schultz.</p>

<p>02</p>

<p>Troublesome</p>

<p>Airbus&nbsp;seems to have fallen into the water.&nbsp;Not only the departure of executives, but also the management of&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;engines, the suppliers of&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;engines have also lost their chains.&nbsp;Not long ago, CFM International&#39;s LEAP series engine supply was delayed, resulting in a serious decline in the delivery of the&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;A320neo&nbsp;and&nbsp;Boeing&nbsp;737MAX series in July compared to June.&nbsp;On the other hand, after exposing a series of defects in the next-generation engine,&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;has also stopped delivering the A320neo&nbsp;jet&nbsp;powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney&#39;s turbine engine,&nbsp;andstopped the pre-delivery test flight after the latest technical difficulties to urge supply. Business.&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;said that a European safety bulletin had already withdrawn the same batch of suspicious batches of&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;containing two engines, affecting about 15-20&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;that were already in use.</p>

<p>The blessings of the blessings are not alone,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the greedy scandals that&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;has always lingered make it exhausted.&nbsp;In February of this year,&nbsp;Airbus&rsquo;s &ldquo;corruption door&rdquo; continued to ferment,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the German inspectorate had ordered&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;to pay 81.25 million euros to resolve the corruption that involved the sale of typhoon fighters to Austria in 2003 during the Endes period.&nbsp;The settlement includes an administrative fine of 250,000 euros&nbsp;and&nbsp;a&nbsp;general&nbsp;definition by law experts of 8.8 million euros to recover the ill-gotten gains.</p>

<p>The giant is not so easy to get down.&nbsp;At the beginning of this year,&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;released its 2017 performance report, which showed that&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;delivered a total of 718&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;to 85 customers throughout the year, an increase of 4% compared to the 688 deliveries in 2016, achieving 15 consecutive years of&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;deliveries. increase.&nbsp;However, it is worth noting that 2017 is the 10th anniversary of the birth of the A380, the world&#39;s largest passenger&nbsp;aircraft. However, due to the failure to obtain new orders, the cancellation of two existing orders has led to the &quot;air&nbsp;giant&quot;. The so-called A380 once reported the risk of discontinuation.&nbsp;It is understood that of the 718&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;delivered by&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;in 2017, there are only 15 A380&nbsp;aircraft.</p>

<p>However, the dilemma of the A380 has a certain sense of &quot;destiny.&quot;&nbsp;Zou Jianjun, a professor at the Civil&nbsp;Aviation&nbsp;Management Institute of China, analyzed in an interview with the Beijing Business Daily that the decline of the A380 was the result of changes in the operating model of&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;companies.&nbsp;With the advancement of technology, the long-haul routes are opening more&nbsp;and&nbsp;more. In view of the fact that more passengers tend to fly instead of transit, the traditional hub operation mode is getting weaker&nbsp;and&nbsp;weaker. &quot;The&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;will also be inferior, the status quo of the A380 is only a judgment of&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;on the development trend.</p>

<p>03</p>

<p>From west to east</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;in the quagmire began to look for a way out.&nbsp;At the beginning of this year,&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;has revealed its willingness to establish a cooperative relationship with China in the A380 industry. At the same time,&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;has also signed an agreement with the Chinese partner to produce the final assembly line of the Tianjin A320 series&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;from the current monthly 4 The rack is gradually increased to six per month.&nbsp;In mid-September, the first&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;A3&nbsp;30&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;completed by the Tianjin assembly line was&nbsp;delivered in Tianjin.</p>

<p>It is understood that China currently only operates five A380s in China Southern Airlines, but according to IATA data, China will replace the United States as the world&#39;s largest&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;market by 2029.&nbsp;In addition, the Asia-Pacific region is the largest operating area of ??the A380. Currently, 54% of the A380 flights are departing&nbsp;or&nbsp;arriving in the Asia-Pacific region,&nbsp;and&nbsp;18% are regional flights in the Asian region.</p>

<p>The potential of the Asia Pacific market has been highlighted.&nbsp;According to the United Nations Census&nbsp;and&nbsp;IATA data, the global &ldquo;flight age&rdquo; population is 4.9 billion,&nbsp;and&nbsp;by 2036 it is expected to grow by 17%, driven mainly by growth in Asia Pacific&nbsp;and&nbsp;Africa.&nbsp;In contrast, the &ldquo;flight age&rdquo; population of the aging population in Europe will fall by an average of 0.5% year-on-year.&nbsp;In the next 20 years, more than half of the new passengers will come from the Asia Pacific region.&nbsp;According to the latest report of the International&nbsp;Air&nbsp;Transport&nbsp;Association, by 2036, the number of new passengers in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to reach 2.1 billion,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the total market passenger traffic will reach 3.5 billion.</p>

<p>Airbus&nbsp;is attacking in all directions.&nbsp;In July of this year,&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;completed the M-Series M&amp;A deal with Canadian regional&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;manufacturer Bombardier&nbsp;Aerospace&nbsp;and&nbsp;its investor Quebec Investment Company,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;also acquired a controlling stake in the C-Series&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;program.&nbsp;Previously, the C series was in a sales dilemma due to multiple project delays, lack of funds,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the United States&#39; chasing&nbsp;and&nbsp;blocking.&nbsp;However, the addition of&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;has caused a fundamental change in the war situation,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it has also triggered a coalition-style confrontation pattern in which the&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;manufacturing enterprises have quickly transformed from a two-pronged&nbsp;and&nbsp;two-pronged pattern.</p>

<p>Airbus&nbsp;teamed up with Bombardier to increase the likelihood of their respective rivals&nbsp;Boeing&nbsp;and&nbsp;Embraer.&nbsp;Also in July,&nbsp;Boeing&nbsp;and&nbsp;Embraer announced the signing of a memorandum industry, to be jointly set up a valuation of&nbsp;47&nbsp;Meiyuan 450 million&nbsp;joint&nbsp;venture, including civilian&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;and&nbsp;industrial&nbsp;services&nbsp;sectors PIA&#39;s.&nbsp;Under the terms of the agreement,&nbsp;Boeing&nbsp;will own 80% of the&nbsp;joint&nbsp;venture company,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Embraer will own the remaining 20%.&nbsp;The original balance of the passenger&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;market has been broken,&nbsp;and&nbsp;how Fu Li stands up to this class also makes people look forward to more.</p>

<p>At the same time,&nbsp;Airbus&#39;s contest with its biggest competitor,&nbsp;Boeing, is also continuing.&nbsp;In the 2017 order battle,&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;achieved a brilliant five-game winning streak, but the order was not the only factor to measure an&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;manufacturer. In the higher-priced wide-body airliner order,&nbsp;Boeing&nbsp;159:46 The big score easily defeated&nbsp;Airbus.&nbsp;In June of this year,&nbsp;Boeing&nbsp;has already reached the Indian market in&nbsp;order to cut&nbsp;Airbus&#39;s latest wide-body passenger&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;A3&nbsp;30&nbsp;neo sales.&nbsp;It is important to know that the Indian market is regarded by&nbsp;Airbus, a European&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;manufacturer, as a crucial stop for the expansion of this&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;sales business to Asia.&nbsp;At that time, the media revealed that Vistara, a&nbsp;joint&nbsp;venture between Singapore Airlines&nbsp;and&nbsp;India&#39;s Tata Group, did not choose&nbsp;Airbus&#39;s model, but chose&nbsp;Boeing&nbsp;787 directly.&nbsp;According to reports, the&nbsp;Airbus&nbsp;aircraft, together with the larger A350&nbsp;aircraft, was designed to compete with the&nbsp;Boeing&nbsp;Dreamliner.</p>",Executives,Positive

Battery-powered, the City-Airbus will be able to take off vertically and land just about anywhere in an urban environment.","<p>Sometime toward the end of this year, Airbus Helicopters will test-fly what it calls the CityAirbus, a multi-passenger, self-piloted eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) vehicle designed for urban air transportation.</p>

<p>Battery-powered, the City-Airbus will be able to take off vertically and land just about anywhere in an urban environment. According to its developers, it will go a long way to easing city traffic congestion.</p>

<p>It is designed to carry up to four passengers over congested megacities to important destinations such as airports or railway stations in a fast, affordable and environmentally friendly way.</p>

<p>Airbus, one of the world&#39;s leading commercial aircraft manufacturers, said the innovative four-ducted propeller configuration significantly contributes to safety and low noise.</p>

<p>Marius Bebesel, CityAirbus&#39; chief engineer, said, &quot;We now have a better understanding of the performance of CityAirbus&#39; innovative electric propulsion system, which we will continue to mature through rigorous testing while beginning the assembly of the full-scale City-Airbus flight demonstrator.&quot;</p>

<p>The first studies on the City-Airbus started in 2015.</p>

<p>&quot;We were watching the rapid change in all areas driven by digitalization and new technologies such as electric propulsion, autonomous vehicles and others,&quot; Bebesel said.</p>

<p>&quot;We investigated how the way people travel could be affected (by these developments) and discovered the area of urban air mobility,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;We came to the conclusion that eVTOL could be a key to future mobility in an urban environment.&quot;</p>

<p>Bebesel said he expected the first flight to take place sometime toward the end of this year, probably in December.</p>

<p>&quot;At the same time, we are working with aviation authorities to set up regulation for the certification of such vehicles and urban air mobility air traffic management. Such regulations are not in place today.&quot;</p>

<p>While Airbus Helicopters is just one of many companies working on flying vehicles, Bebesel said several countries are showing a keen interest in this project, although he declined to name them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is understood that China, as well as watching developments in its domestic industry, is paying attention to the CityAirbus.</p>

<p>China is one of the world&#39;s largest operators of Airbus commercial aircraft, and the European giant has a number of joint ventures with aircraft companies in the country.</p>

<p>Bebesel said the CityAirbus is designed to ease ground congestion, especially in cities burdened with heavy traffic as urban populations continue to expand.</p>

<p>&quot;CityAirbus is a multi-passenger, self-piloted, battery-powered, vertical takeoff and landing vehicle designed to carry up to four passengers on fixed routes over congested megacities in a fast, affordable and environmentally friendly way,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Asked whether flying vehicles are simply solving one problem while creating another in the air, he said, &quot;We don&#39;t expect such a huge number of aerial vehicles to be operated.&quot;</p>

<p>As to who would control the airspace that flying vehicles eventually operate in, Bebesel said: &quot;This is one of the questions which still have to be worked out with all involved parties. Different solutions in different parts of the world are likely.</p>

<p>&quot;Safety, however, is of utmost importance for each aerial vehicle. Being a manufacturer of aircraft for more than five decades, we have a long track record in providing safe solutions.&quot;</p>

<p>The CityAirbus is designed for a cruising speed of 120 kilometers per hour, with a typical one-way flight lasting about 15 minutes, or about 30 km.</p>

<p>&quot;This is sufficient for reaching important spots in an urban environment,&quot; Bebesel said.</p>",Commercial,Positive
